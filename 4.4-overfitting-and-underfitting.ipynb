    "In all the examples we saw in the previous chapter -- movie review sentiment prediction, topic classification, and house price regression -- \n",
    "we could notice that the performance of our model on the held-out validation data would always peak after a few epochs and would then start \n",
    "degrading, i.e. our model would quickly start to _overfit_ to the training data. Overfitting happens in every single machine learning \n",
    "problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of \n",
    "adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the \"learning\" in \"machine learning\"), while \"generalization\" \n",
    "refers to how well the trained model would perform on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of \n",
    "course, but you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on \n",
    "test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet \n",
    "modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops \n",
    "improving, validation metrics stall then start degrading: the model is then starting to over-fit, i.e. is it starting to learn patterns \n",
    "that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get \n",
    "more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution \n",
    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",
    "store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most \n",
    "prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing of fighting overfitting in this way is called _regularization_. Let's review some of the most common regularization \n",
    "techniques, and let's apply them in practice to improve our movie classification model from  the previous chapter."
