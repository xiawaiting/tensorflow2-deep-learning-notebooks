    "problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of \n",
    "adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the \"learning\" in \"machine learning\"), while \"generalization\" \n",

    "course, but you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on \n",
    "test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet \n",

    "\n",
    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get \n",
    "more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution \n",
    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",
    "store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most \n",
    "prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is \n",
    "determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is \n",
    "often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore \n",
    "will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any \n",
    "generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the \n",
    "MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying \n",
    "new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge \n",
    "is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in \n",
    "order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets \n",
    "-- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have \n",
    "enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be \n",
    "found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You \n",
    "will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) in order to find the \n",
    "right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and \n",
