    "A common and highly effective approach to deep learning on small image datasets is to leverage a pre-trained network. A pre-trained network \n",
    "is simply a saved network previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image classification task. If this original \n",
    "dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre-trained network can effectively act as a \n",
    "generic model of our visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these \n",
    "new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task. For instance, one might train a network on \n",
    "ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then re-purpose this trained network for something as remote as \n",
    "identifying furniture items in images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning \n",
    "compared to many older shallow learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will consider a large convnet trained on the ImageNet dataset (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes). \n",
    "ImageNet contains many animal classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and we can thus expect to perform very well on our cat \n",
    "vs. dog classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the VGG16 architecture, developed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in 2014, a simple and widely used convnet architecture \n",
    "for ImageNet. Although it is a bit of an older model, far from the current state of the art and somewhat heavier than many other recent \n",
    "models, we chose it because its architecture is similar to what you are already familiar with, and easy to understand without introducing \n",
    "any new concepts. This may be your first encounter with one of these cutesie model names -- VGG, ResNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet, \n",
