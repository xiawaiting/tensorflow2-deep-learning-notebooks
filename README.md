# Tensorflow 2.x Deep Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks adapted for Tensorflow 2.x, implementing the code samples found in the book [Deep Learning with Python (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff). Additionally, it includes some contents from the book [Python ile Derin Öğrenme (http://buzdagiyayinevi.com/python-ile-derin-ogrenme/).

These notebooks use Python 3.x and Kerass within Tensorflow 2.0
