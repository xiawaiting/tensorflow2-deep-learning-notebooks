    "practice if you ever do computer vision in a professional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"few\" samples can mean anywhere from a few hundreds to a few tens of thousands of images. As a practical example, we will focus on \n",
    "classifying images as \"dogs\" or \"cats\", in a dataset containing 4000 pictures of cats and dogs (2000 cats, 2000 dogs). We will use 2000 \n",
    "pictures for training, 1000 for validation, and finally 1000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new model from scratch on what little data we have. We \n",
    "will start by naively training a small convnet on our 2000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline for what can be \n",
    "achieved. This will get us to a classification accuracy of 71%. At that point, our main issue will be overfitting. Then we will introduce \n",
    "*data augmentation*, a powerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision. By leveraging data augmentation, we will improve \n",
    "our network to reach an accuracy of 82%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will review two more essential techniques for applying deep learning to small datasets: *doing feature extraction \n",
    "with a pre-trained network* (this will get us to an accuracy of 90% to 93%), and *fine-tuning a pre-trained network* (this will get us to \n",
    "our final accuracy of 95%). Together, these three strategies -- training a small model from scratch, doing feature extracting using a \n",
    "pre-trained model, and fine-tuning a pre-trained model -- will constitute your future toolbox for tackling the problem of doing computer \n",
