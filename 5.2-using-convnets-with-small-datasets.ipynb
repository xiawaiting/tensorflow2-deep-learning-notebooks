    "\n",
    "Having to train an image classification model using only very little data is a common situation, which you likely encounter yourself in \n",
    "practice if you ever do computer vision in a professional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"few\" samples can mean anywhere from a few hundreds to a few tens of thousands of images. As a practical example, we will focus on \n",
    "classifying images as \"dogs\" or \"cats\", in a dataset containing 4000 pictures of cats and dogs (2000 cats, 2000 dogs). We will use 2000 \n",
    "pictures for training, 1000 for validation, and finally 1000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new model from scratch on what little data we have. We \n",
    "will start by naively training a small convnet on our 2000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline for what can be \n",
    "achieved. This will get us to a classification accuracy of 71%. At that point, our main issue will be overfitting. Then we will introduce \n",
    "*data augmentation*, a powerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision. By leveraging data augmentation, we will improve \n",
    "our network to reach an accuracy of 82%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will review two more essential techniques for applying deep learning to small datasets: *doing feature extraction \n",
    "with a pre-trained network* (this will get us to an accuracy of 90% to 93%), and *fine-tuning a pre-trained network* (this will get us to \n",
    "our final accuracy of 95%). Together, these three strategies -- training a small model from scratch, doing feature extracting using a \n",

    "## The relevance of deep learning for small-data problems\n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available. This is in part a valid point: one fundamental \n",
    "characteristic of deep learning is that it is able to find interesting features in the training data on its own, without any need for manual \n",
    "feature engineering, and this can only be achieved when lots of training examples are available. This is especially true for problems where \n",
    "the input samples are very high-dimensional, like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what constitutes \"lots\" of samples is relative -- relative to the size and depth of the network you are trying to train, for \n",
    "starters. It isn't possible to train a convnet to solve a complex problem with just a few tens of samples, but a few hundreds can \n",
    "potentially suffice if the model is small and well-regularized and if the task is simple. \n",
    "Because convnets learn local, translation-invariant features, they are very \n",
    "data-efficient on perceptual problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will still yield reasonable results \n",
    "despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any custom feature engineering. You will see this in action in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's more, deep learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can take, say, an image classification or speech-to-text model \n",
    "trained on a large-scale dataset then reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes. Specifically, in the case of \n",
    "computer vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet dataset) are now publicly available for download and can be used \n",
    "to bootstrap powerful vision models out of very little data. That's what we will do in the next section.\n",
